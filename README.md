# Exploring Natural Language

This project is a **Swift Playground** that explains core machine learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP) concepts and showcases Apple's new **Natural Language** framework through a visually appealing experience. Some of the technologies used were CoreML, UIKit, PlaygroundBook, CreateML and the framework itself, along with three different publicly available datasets.

I used this project as a submission to the **WWDC19 Scholarships** program and it was accepted. As a reward, I got to attend WWDC 2019 with my travel expenses covered by Apple and meet the engineers who built the frameworks we use daily. üòÅ

## What I‚Äôve Learned
- Important ML & NLP concepts
- How to use Natural Language framework
- How to use CreateML to train text recognition models
- How to create engaging learning experiences using Swift Playgrounds

## Instructions
1. Open the project using Xcode;
2. Select the "PlaygroundBook" target and build it;
3. At the very last folder, named "Products" you should see a new .playgroundbook file;
4. Right-click it, and click on "Show on Finder";
5. AirDrop the file to your iPad;
6. Have fun!

## Requirements
- Xcode 10 (may not work on newer versions, use Swift 4.2 toolchain if needed)
- iPad running iOS 12+
- Swift Playgrounds 2.0+
