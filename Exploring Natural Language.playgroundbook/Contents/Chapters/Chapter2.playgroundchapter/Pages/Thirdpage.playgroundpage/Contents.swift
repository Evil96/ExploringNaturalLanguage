 # Categorizing the News
 
 The last dataset we are going to take a look at is the [20 Newsgroups Dataset](http://qwone.com/~jason/20Newsgroups/). Its data is comprised of 20000 documents split into 20 different newsgroups. This kind of classification may come in handy when we want to quickly assign huge amounts of data into predefined categories.
 
 ## Using the Dataset
 
 To implement the model and help Fred categorize the magazines for us, let‚Äôs change the ``enableClassification`` variable below to ``true``. Upon running your code, they should all be correctly organized based on their newsgroup.
 */
  var enableClassification = /*#-editable-code*/false/*#-end-editable-code*/
/*:
 Let‚Äôs also try altering the ``articleTitle`` string below to a different article name to check if the algorithm correctly guesses what it‚Äôs about. Use a title you would expect to see in an article of something you enjoy, such as science, technology and so on.
 */
 var articleTitle = /*#-editable-code*/"Apple announces the new iMac"/*#-end-editable-code*/
